# Welcome to SICSS-Zurich: 14-18 June 2021

SICSS-Zurich will take place online from June 14 to June 18, 2021.

## About this repo
We will use this GitHub repo to share Zurich-specific information with you. Please also consult the [official website for our site](https://sicss.io/2021/ethzurich/).

## Pre-event preparation
As in past years, we recommend some pre-event preparation (reading, coding exercises). These preparations are not meant to be burdensome. We have found that they lead to a richer event. We are happy to help you with your preparations (see office hours below).

Recommended readings (this list will be updated over time):
- [Python for Economists](http://egallic.fr/Enseignement/Python/en/opening-remarks.html), by Ewen Gallic
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, by Aurelien Geron

## Pre-event office hours
You can meet us on Fridays between 10:00-12:00 (from April onwards). Please book your slot [here](https://calendly.com/sicss-ethz2021/15min?month=2021-04).
