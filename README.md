# Welcome to SICSS-Zurich: 14-18 June 2021

SICSS-Zurich will take place online from June 14 to June 18, 2021.

## About this repo
We will use this GitHub repo to share Zurich-specific information with you. Please also consult the [official website for our site](https://sicss.io/2021/ethzurich/).

## Pre-event preparation
As in past years, we recommend some pre-event preparation (reading, coding exercises). These preparations are not meant to be burdensome. We have found that they lead to a richer event. We are happy to help you with your preparations (see office hours below).

Recommended readings (this list will be updated over time):
- [Python for Economists](http://egallic.fr/Enseignement/Python/en/opening-remarks.html), by Ewen Gallic
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems, by Aurelien Geron

## Pre-event office hours
You can meet us on Fridays between 10:00-12:00 (from April onwards). Please book your slot [here](https://calendly.com/sicss-ethz2021/15min?month=2021-04).

## Preliminary schedule

The days will be organized around topics, with one broad topic per day:
- Day 1: Introduction to statistical learning
- Day 2: Scraping and APIs
- Day 3: Classification and regression
- Day 4: Text as data
- Day 5: Images as data

Time-wise, we will go about the days as follows:
- 10:00-12:30: Teaching input
- 12:30-16:30: Independent work in groups
- 16:30-17:30: Participant presentations; debriefing and wrap-up

Along the way, there will be some input by guest speakers and lectures from the main venue in Princeton.

## SICSS festival

Usually (pre-COVID), the SICSS consists of a series of locally hosted in-person events around the world that are connected to each other by online lectures. To make SICSS as worthwile as possible, even in the absence of locally hosted events, the parent location in Princeton coordinates a SICSS festival. It is an online festival with different events around computational social science. The program is continuously updated here: https://sicss.io/festival.

### Levy, Samuel

I am a PhD candidate in the Environmental Policy Lab at ETH Zürich with an interdisciplinary background, having previously studied social anthropology, geography and environmental science. My research investigates the relationship between land use, livelihoods and global supply chains, with a specific focus on the effectiveness and equity of zero deforestation initiatives in the cattle sector of the Brazilian Amazon. To understand these issues, I primarily use econometric and network analysis approaches to analyse data that is either remotely sensed or collected from the field. However, I am increasingly drawn towards data science techniques, such as web scraping and machine learning and am excited to learn more through the SICSS!
